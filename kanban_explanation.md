# Kanban Board Explanation

## What is a Kanban Board?

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that helps teams track tasks across different stages of a workflow. It uses columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done") to represent the status of tasks and limits work-in-progress (WIP) to prevent bottlenecks.

## How My Kanban Board Works

1. **Visualizes Workflow**:  
   - The board consists of custom columns: "To Do," "In Progress," "Testing," "Blocked," and "Done."  
   - Each task moves through these columns, providing a clear view of its progress.

2. **Limits Work-in-Progress (WIP)**:  
   - To ensure focused work, the board limits WIP to 3 tasks per column. This prevents overload and ensures tasks are completed before new ones are started.

3. **Supports Agile Principles**:  
   - The board enables continuous delivery by allowing tasks to flow seamlessly through stages.  
   - It adapts to changing requirements, as new columns (e.g., "Blocked") can be added dynamically.

4. **Enhances Collaboration**:  
   - Tasks are linked to GitHub Issues, and team members are assigned using `@mentions`.  
   - Labels (e.g., `bug`, `feature`) clarify task priorities and categories.

Here below is the example kanban board I created with Github Projects
