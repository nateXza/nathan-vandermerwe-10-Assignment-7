# Template Analysis and Selection

## Comparison Table of GitHub Project Templates

| Template Name       | Columns/Workflows                          | Automation Features                          | Suitability for Agile Methodologies         |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Basic Kanban        | To Do, In Progress, Done                  | Manual task movement; no automation         | Simple workflows; lacks advanced features   |
| Automated Kanban    | To Do, In Progress, Done, Testing          | Auto-move issues based on labels/status     | Supports sprint tracking and continuous flow|
| Bug Triage          | Triage, Needs Fix, In Progress, Resolved   | Auto-assigns priority based on labels       | Ideal for issue-focused projects            |
| Team Planning       | Backlog, Sprint, In Progress, Done         | Sprints, milestone tracking, auto-updates   | Best for team collaboration and sprint-based work |

## Justification for Template Selection

The **Automated Kanban** template was selected as the most suitable for this project because it aligns with the Agile methodologies used in software development. The following reasons justify this choice:

1. **Automation Features**:  
   - Automatically moves tasks between columns based on labels or status updates, reducing manual effort and ensuring real-time tracking of progress.

2. **Sprint Tracking**:  
   - Includes columns like "Testing" and "In Progress," which are essential for iterative development cycles such as those used in Agile sprints.

3. **Customizability**:  
   - Allows for additional columns (e.g., "Blocked") to be added, ensuring alignment with specific project needs.

4. **QA Integration**:  
   - The "Testing" column directly supports quality assurance workflows, which are critical for validating system behavior.
