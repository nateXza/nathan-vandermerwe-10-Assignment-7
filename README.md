# Kanban Board Customization

The Kanban board was customized to better align with our project's workflow and QA requirements. The following changes were made:

1. **Added 'Testing' Column**: Ensures tasks undergo proper quality assurance before being marked as done.
2. **Added 'Blocked' Column**: Tracks tasks that are delayed due to external factors or dependencies.
3. **Linked GitHub Issues**: Each task is linked to its corresponding GitHub Issue for traceability.
4. **Assigned Tasks**: Used @mentions to assign responsibilities to team members.

These customizations ensure the board reflects our Agile principles and supports efficient task management.
