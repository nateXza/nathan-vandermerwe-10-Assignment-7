# Reflection

## Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template

1. **Choosing the Right Template**:  
   Deciding between **Automated Kanban** and **Team Planning** was challenging. While both support Agile methodologies, **Automated Kanban** offered better automation features for our smaller team size.

2. **Customizing the Board**:  
   Adding custom columns like "Blocked" and "Testing" required careful thought to ensure all workflow stages were represented without overcomplicating the process.

3. **Linking Issues**:  
   Ensuring that GitHub Issues from Assignment 6 were accurately linked to the board involved meticulous organization and coordination.

## Comparison to Other Tools

- **Trello**:  
  While Trello offers similar functionality, GitHub Projects integrates directly with repositories, making it more suitable for software development.

- **Jira**:  
  Jira is powerful but overly complex for small teams. GitHub Projects strikes a balance between simplicity and functionality [[2]].

## Lessons Learned

1. **Importance of Automation**:  
   Automating task movement saves time and ensures consistency.

2. **Flexibility is Key**:  
   The ability to add custom columns ensures the board remains relevant as project requirements evolve.

3. **Collaboration Enhancements**:  
   Linking tasks to GitHub Issues and assigning them to team members improves accountability and transparency.

Overall, this exercise highlighted the value of visual project management tools in maintaining clarity and focus during software development.
